        Wolverine was born as James Howlett in northern Alberta, Canada, (approximately near Cold Lake) during the late 1880s, purportedly to rich farm owners John and Elizabeth Howlett,[29] though he is actually the illegitimate son of the Howletts' groundskeeper, Thomas Logan.[30] 
        After Thomas is thrown off the Howletts' property for an attempted rape perpetrated by his other son, named simply Dog, he returns to the Howlett manor and kills John Howlett.
         In retaliation, young James kills Thomas with bone claws that emerge from the back of his hands, as his mutation manifests.[31] He flees with his childhood companion, Rose, and grows into manhood on a mining colony in the Yukon, adopting the name "Logan".[32] 
         When Logan accidentally kills Rose with his claws, he flees the colony and lives in the wilderness among wolves,[33] until he is captured and placed in a circus.[34] Saul Creed, brother of Victor Creed, frees Logan, but after he betrays Logan and Clara Creed to Nathaniel Essex, Logan drowns Creed in Essex's potion.[35] 
         Logan returns to civilization, residing with the Blackfoot people. Following the death of his Blackfoot lover, Silver Fox, at the hands of Victor Creed, now known as Sabretooth,[36] he is ushered into the Canadian military during World War I. Logan spends time in Madripoor before settling in Japan, where he marries Itsu and has a son, Daken. 
         Logan is unaware of his son for many years.
